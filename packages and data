terrorism_data  = pd.read_csv(r'C:\\Users\\pjvdw\\Desktop\\terrorism\\fatalities-from-terrorism.csv')
#Things to do for data: 
#Clean - only use countries with data for both 2000 and 2020 - exclude all else. 




#Intention for this script: 
#I am going to perform regression analysis to determine which factors can lead to a rise in fatalities from terrorism. 
#The terrorism related fatalities data is from ourworldindata.com. 
#GDP data is from the World bank.
